 * In multithreaded programming, often several identical worker threads are fed with
 * a single input queue. If we want to replace threads with actors, this cannot be done
 * directly, as actors may not be blocked (which happens when the queue is empty). 
 * This sample code shows how to build a demultiplexer to feed several actors with single queue.
 * Actors work in parallel. 
 * The actor wanting to be fed sends itself to the actors port with Demux.listen(this).
