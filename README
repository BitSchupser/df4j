df4j is a basic dataflow library. It can easily be extended for specific needs.

df4j-core contains core functionality. It requires java 1.5 or higher.
df4j-demux (in progress) base for remote and/or persistent actors.
df4j-nio2 contains a wrapper to nio2 asyncronous input-output functionality.
It requires java 1.7 or higher.

See examples directories for various custom-made dataflow objects and their usage.
